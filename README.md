 I am creating a rent car application that can be used in a rental car business. The application is structured from two perspectives. One is for the administrator(Rental Company) and on the other hand the user(Client).The purpose of this application is to allow an administrator(Rental Company) to create an account. Once the account has been created, the administrator can now add a car,(Name, Model,Type,Fabrication year, Identification Number) and post the vehicles for rent or sell  for the clients who are looking to rent a vehicle to be able to select the car of their choice by (Model,Price,Category). My goal is to enhance the client experience.
